# turtle
Turtle program to draw words or draw new symbols from the keyboard.

The project has two programms the user can choose from: The first one draws out a words made out of letters and beforhand introduced special characters. The letters are defined in signs.py. The second programm is more "interactive", in the sense that the user can draw a new symbol using the WASD arrows. The new character is then saved in a dictionary, from where it can be used anytime without having to define it again. If it is however redefined, the older version will be changed with the new one.
